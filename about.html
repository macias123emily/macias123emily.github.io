              <p> I am currently a tenth grader at Granada High School in Livermore, California who loves to learn new things and explore the world around her. I am very passionate about STEM and representing my Latino culture properly. Due to this, I aspire to not only become a mehanical engineer, but an advocate for my beliefs and community. Although academics are an increasingly important factor within my life, I also enjoy running, learning, admiring nature, and sharing ideas with other people. This is reflected through my hobby of drawing as I am able to express my ideas and recreate those of the natural world or the people around me. I am bilingual with Spanish being my first language, and my favorite color is blue.</p>

              <p> Some of my goals include:</p>
              <ol>
              	<li> Living in a different country for a year.</li>
              	<li> Receiving a 4.0 GPA during high school.</li>
              	<li> Becoming a mechanical engineer.</li>
              	<li> Placing in the top 3 within a cross country competition.</li>
              </ol>
